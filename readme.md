## Compilation
Assuming Antlr and Jasmin are installed as the `antlr4` and `jasmin` commands respectively, one can compile the compiler with a quick `make`. To compile all the tests, run `make build-tests`.

If Antlr is installed as `antlr`, try `antlr=antlr make` instead.

## Tests
To run (and build, if necessary) all the tests run `make test-all`. There are also `make test-*` commands for each test.
